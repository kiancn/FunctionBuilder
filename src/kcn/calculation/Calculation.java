 * The Calculation class allows the creation of objects able to perform complex calculations.
 * <p>You can check out the examples in the CalculationTest-class.</p>
 * <p> Please refer to the https://github.com/kiancn/FunctionBuilder/edit/master/README.md
 * for information on use of the class; until a stable version is reached. </p>
 * <p></p>
 * <p><b>Calculations are evaluated in the following sequence of steps:</b></p>
 * <p>a. first all (single) expressions are resolved
 * (binding operators are <i>not</i>).</p>
 * <p>b. second the 'un-bound' expressions are interpreted as belonging to one single expression consisting
 * of the results
 * of the previous calculations AND the binding operators (:a binding operators bind evaluated expressions
 * through its operation upon them (and the result)); it is resolved/calculated, and there is your
 * answer...</p>
 * <p></p>
 * <p> <b>A single expression</b> consist of factors (numbers) and operators; the term is here used so that
 * an expression is any set of factors and operators that can be evaluated/calculated going from left to
 * right (see rules).</p>
 * <p>A <b>binding operator is any operator <i>+, -, /, *, mod, pow </i>or<i> root</i></b> acting on
 * two expressions that could be written in separate parenthesis, like <i>(2) * (5+7)</i>  - here * is a
 * binding operator.</p>
